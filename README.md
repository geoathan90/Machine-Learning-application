# Machine-Learning-NBA-application

The aim of this project is to twofold. Firstly, I want to practice working with web-scraping and assemble a database that is hosted locally. Secondly, I want to apply some Machine Learning and Neural Network techniques to process these data and then visualize the results.

I mainly use Matlab and Python, since I'm proficient mostly with those two languages, but I aim to recreate these projects using R in the future.

Thank you for visiting and please contact me if you have any questions!
